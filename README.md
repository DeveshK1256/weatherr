The weather forecast app will have a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can input a location in a search bar, and the app will show the current weather conditions for that area. I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather information based on the userâ€™s location input. The app also offers extra information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, a weather icon depicting the current conditions, and a background image of the searched location.
